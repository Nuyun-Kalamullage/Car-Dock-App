People look for convenience and ease of use in terms of a mobile app. There are countless people looking to buy cars, and also sell their cars. Having a mobile app makes it easy for people to do just this. You are a mobile app developer, and you want to kick-start this business idea. You are to provide the following before you start properly developing this idea and making it into an app. 1. Presentation of the proposed solution for this kind of app (include as many functionalities you can think of) - develop the basic business idea. 2.
